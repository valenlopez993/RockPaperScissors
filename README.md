# Rock Paper Scissors

This project is part of the [Free Code Camp Machine Learning course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/#how-neural-networks-work). The goal of the project was to build a program capable of beating four different strategies in the classic game of **rock, paper, and scissors**.

These strategies are implemented as four different bots:
- quincy
- abbey
- kris
- mrugesh

The final program is capable of winning against each of the 4 bots at least 60% of the time.
